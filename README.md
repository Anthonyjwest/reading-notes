Hello my name is Anthony Westerfield and I live in Pennsylvania! I am 24 years old and throughout my life I have lived in 6 different states! My dad was in the military growing up, so we moved around alot! Fun Fact, I attended 10 differnent schools throughout my childhood! My interest are music, video games, sports, and my favorite color is purple! For awhile I use to create music using FL Studio, I mostly made edm type music or hip hop instrumentals! I am a very down to earth person, good sense of humour, and easy to get along with!
