# **Growth Mindset** 

To me, growth mindset is the key to achieving whatever you set your mind too and getting it done to your best ability! Whether thats doing something you love or just getting work done for a job or school! 

## _Reminders to Myself_

1. When things get tough or overwhelming, dont give up or get negative. Take a breather, relax your brain and body, then come back when I feel motivated!

2. Continue to live a healthy lifestyle and dont get lazy.

3. Strive everyday to learn more and grow as a developer , as well as a better human being!
