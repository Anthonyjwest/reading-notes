# My Introduction

Hello my name is Anthony Westerfield and I live in Pennsylvania! I am 24 years old and throughout my life I have lived in 6 different states! My dad was in the military growing up, so we moved around alot! Fun Fact, I attended 10 differnent schools throughout my childhood! My interest are music, video games, sports, and my favorite color is purple! For awhile I use to create music using FL Studio, I mostly made edm type music or hip hop instrumentals! I am a very down to earth person, good sense of humour, and easy to get along with! Im excited to start this new journey in my life and meet new people! githgub link: [My Github Portfolio](https://github.com/Anthonyjwest).
