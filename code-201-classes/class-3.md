## When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?

Use a unordered list when the list your creating has no meaningful order.

## How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?

Within the < ul > tag you would insert a "type" to change the bullets. There are three other types: circle, disc, and square.

## When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?

If you are listing items that have a specified order and have numerical values associated with them, you  should use a ordered list. If your creating a list that has no meaning in terms of order, than an unordered list will be the best fit.

## Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?

One way is changing the actual type of the list item numbers by inserting a "type" inside the < ol > tag. You change the type to Letters or Roman Numerals, lowercase and uppercase. The other way to chnage the numbers in a ordered list is inserting a "reversed" in the < ol > tag. This will reverse the order the numbers appear, so now they will appear highest to lowest, instead of lowest to highest.

## Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?

Mr Margin was the leader of boxes within his own specific box. He always makes sure everyone is together all wrapped up and in the correct place. He always makes sure everyone has enough room and that the evil elements give them enough space to live peacefully on their own. While Mr Margin was doing his job on the outside, Mrs padding had the important role of keeping the precious content inside and making sure they are in the correct places within the border.

## List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model

First we have the content box, this contains our content and displays it. Next we have the padding box, the padding sits around our content and creates white space. The border box wraps around our content and any padding. Lastly we have the margin box, it is the outermost layer and wraps the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box it has created and other elements.

## What data types can you store inside of an Array?

We can store Strings, numbers, objects, and even other arrays.

## Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?

 const people = [['pete', 32, 'librarian', null], ['Smith', 40, 'accountant', 'fishing:hiking:rock_climbing'], ['bill', null, 'artist', null]];

The array is a valid array. Arrays can mix data types within each array and have multiple arrays! Say we wanted to access the value 'accountant', We would find it like so:

people[ 1 ] [ 2 ];

## List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do

Assignment: x = f(), this assigns are variable to a value

Addition: x += f(), this assigns are variable to our value plus our variable

Subtraction: x -= f(), this assigns are variable to our variable minus our value

Multiplication: x *= f(), this assigns are variable to our value multiplied by our variable

Division: x /= f(), this assigns are variable to our variable divided by our value.

## Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why

 let a = 10;
 let b = 'dog';
 let c = false;

 // evaluate this
 (a + c) + b;

 The code will evaluate to this: 10dog. False will not show in our evaluation, only numbers and strings will show.

## Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program

Voting, we can create a conditional statement that has three options. If user inputs one name, we add +1 to that name. If else the other name, we add +1 to that name. Else no input or neither of the available names are chosen than it can be +0 to no one.

## Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript

When prompting the user to input a password. The code will run endlessy until the correct password is given.
