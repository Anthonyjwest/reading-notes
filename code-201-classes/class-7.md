## Explain why we need domain modeling

It is a great universal tool to validate and verify the understanding of a specific problem. It also acts as a great communication tool that creates vocabulary that everyone can understand.

## Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

It will create confusion for visually imparied users, it will create jumbled tags and make your code harder to read and write, and lastly it will be make the table less accessible and responsive.

## List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML < table >

td, creates a table cell and it displays table data

th, this creates table headers, these create headers that start a row or column

## What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

A constructor is a function that uses a "new" keyword to call and get an output. It allows us to use the same code to get different outputs for multiple objects.

## How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

When using this in a object literal it will refer to the object it is inside, but when used in a constructor, this will bind to the "new" object, and you can reuse this within that constructor.
