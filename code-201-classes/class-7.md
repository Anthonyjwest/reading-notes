## Explain why we need domain modeling

It is a great universal tool to validate and verify the understanding of a specific problem. It also acts as a great communication tool that creates vocabulary that everyone can understand.

## Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

It will create confusion for visually imparied users, it will create jumbled tags and make your code harder to read and write, and lastly it will be make the table less accessible and responsive.

## List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML < table >

td, creates a table cell and it displays table data
tr, creates a table row and you would put td inside tr tags
th, this creates table headers, these create headers that start a row or column

## What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

A constructor is a function that uses a "new" keyword to call and get an output. It allows us to use the same code to get different outputs for multiple objects.

## How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

When using this in a object literal it will refer to the object it is inside, but when used in a constructor, this will bind to the "new" object, and you can reuse this within that constructor.

## Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience

At an animal shelter where I used to work we would have multiple rooms set up for cats specifically, the prototype for "Catroom" would be mulitple kennels, food station, and cleaning supplies. Than for each room we would set up different cat names and locations specific to the room they were in. From each room we can have a "parent" that describes the types of kittens in each room. From elderly cats, sick cats, kittens, and medical cats. We can use inheritance to find the number of cats for each type there is in each individual room. The parent room "catrooms" contains all types of cats, than throguh each new "room" we can find out which types of cats are in each room.
