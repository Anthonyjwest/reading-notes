## Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error

A syntax error is when spelling is incorrect, while logic errors is when the expected outcome of a problem is wrong. Syntax errors are easier to spot and fix, while logic errors are often times hard to find.

## List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them

Small grammar mistakes, easy fix. But some logic mistakes I have made were not putting a variable into the argument of a function when calling it, causing the function to not return the correct values. It took me some minutes of looking through each line of code to find this error.

## How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

Being weary of syntax and logic errors will help me in this journey to write clean code and be aware of common mistakes and try to reduce them as much as possible.

## How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

The debugger is a tool that developers can use to see specific parts of there code and see if there are any errors.  Instead of fixing an entire house we can can scale it down and look at small parts that make up the whole house to make sure those are all working correctly.

## Define what a breakpoint is

A breakpoint is where we want our code to stop executing to analyze everything from the start to our breakpoint.

## What is the call stack?

When our code is running the call stack shows us what code was executed to get to our current line.
