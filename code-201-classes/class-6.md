## How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

An object is like a dictionary that you can access whenever your looking for a certain "word". Think of the the object as the word we are trying to find, and the definition  is the value stored inside the object.

## What are some advantages to creating object literals?

Some advantages of object literals, is less code, easier and more convient ways to call the code, and overall flexibility.

## How do objects differ from arrays?

Objects store strings into values, while arrays map numbers to values.

## Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation

If an object property name is stored in a variable, than you must use bracket to notation to call it.

## Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?

const dog = {
  name: 'Spot',
  age: 2,
  color: 'white with black spots',
  humanAge: function (){
    console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age*7} in human years`);
  }
}

This refers to the  object name "dog". This is useful to use to simplify our code because when this is used within an object the code will know that this is refering to the objecet.

## What is the DOM?

It is a programming interface for web documents. It allows the program to change the documents style, structure and content.

## Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript

The DOM allows javascript to fully understand any model or notion of webpages and html documents.
