## Why are forms so important in web development?

Forms allow users to input data which is than stored and processed in the web server. Forms are a way to let users interact with our websites and actually in some instances change the content on our page.

## When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?

Keep it simple and straight to the point. Only ask the user for data that is important to your page.

## List 5 form elements and explain their importance

Form element - this creates our form and is a container.

label element - this labels what we are making and puts a name to the input we recieve.

input element - this allows the user to input there data and it tells us how to use the data we recieve.

textarea element - this creates a multi line text box that allows users to write a longer response.

button element - this creates a clickable button on our form to submit or reset the form.

## How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?

An event is like an alarm clock, the time is an element and when it reaches a certain point it triggers an event, and that event being 'play the alarm set to this time'.

## When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?

We need a tring to tell what our addeventlistener is looking for, in example a click or a mouseover.  We also need a function to call when the event is called.

## Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?

It is a way to set extra features and information. The target is important to have within an event object because it references to element that the event occured on.

## What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?

event bubbling is when the event moves from the inner most element to the target, while event capturing is when the event moves from the outermost element to the target.

## Things I want to know more about

Events and more ways to dynamically use them.
