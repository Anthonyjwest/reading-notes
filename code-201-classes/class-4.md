## To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

We wrap the text link in the < a > tag

## The href attribute contains what information?

The hypertext reference contains the web address

## What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

Provide keywords in link to describe what the link is going to, dont repeat the URL in the link text, dont include the word "link" or "links" in your actual link, and keep your link short and simple but precise.

## What is meant by “normal flow”?

Normal flow layout is the basic way a browser will present your page if there is no CSS added to your page.

## What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

Block level elements are laid out vertically meaning the appear on the next line below the last one. Inline elements dont appear on new lines, they will stay on the same line until there is no room left. If there isnt any space it will move onto the next line.

## __ positioning is the default for every html element

Static positioning

## Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element

When an element is in absolute positioning it doesnt sit in the basic flow, it has its own layer seperate from everything else. We can create seperate UI features that dont interfere with other layers and elements.

## What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

Fixed positioning sets an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport. Absolute sets an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor.

## Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation

A function declaration is just setting up the function and creating it, a function invocation is when your activating it and wanting the code to run inside of it.

## What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

A parameter is a variable assigned in the functions definition, while a argument is the actual value that is passed through when the function is invoked.

## Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey

I think the engaged colaboration and learning from other fellow students would be the two benefits I look forward to the most. These two go hand in hand with each other, While working with other students I can see there working styles and possibly adapt to how they do it if I find it easier and more useful. Overall having someone to work with on code will keep me from procastination and keep my focus and motivation on track!

## Things I want to know more about

Positioning and Global scopes
