## Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means

Flexbox is best used when wanting to structure simple elements, like headings, paragraphs, and or links.

## Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis

Main axis is set to the main flex direction your css has. If your flex direction is set to row, than the main axis will align to your row, and vice versa if your flex directon is set to column. The cross axis will be the opposite of your main axis. Meaning if your flexx direction is set to row than the cross axis will set to the column, and vice versa.

## How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

If you are using the row-reverse and column-reverse values, it can cause logical errors if someone that is visually impaired trys to use your sites screen reader. The contents order will be displayed properly, but the logical order will not and when reading the screen it will mess up the order for the user.
