### Command Dictionary

2. ls - short list, simple command lists all contents within current directory
3. cd - Change directory, allows user to change current directory location
4. mkdir - Make Directory, creates new folder within current directory

### Example Explanation

1. cd projects

2. mkdir new-project

3. touch new-project/newfile.md

4. cd ..

5. ls projects/new-project

Line 1 - We are changing our current directory to projects folder

Line 2 - Now we are making a new directory titled "new-project" within projects

Line 3 - This creates a new file named "newfile.md" within the new directory "new-project"

Line 4 - This command will bring us back to the last parent directory within our current directory, which in this case would be projects

Line 5 - Finally were gonna list what is in the path /projects/new-project

Line 6 would display "newfile.md" showing what was inside /newproject
