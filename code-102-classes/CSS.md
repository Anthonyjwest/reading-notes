# CSS

## What is the Purpose of CSS?

CSS which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, allows us to create great looking web pages. The purpose of CSS is to present documents with stlye, how there laid out and creativity.

## What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project?

+ External- change the look of entire website with one file (inside link > head)
+ Internal- Used if one single HTML page has a unique style (inside style > head)
+ Inline- Used to style a single element

## Write an example of a CSS rule that would give all < p > elements red text

For this example I am using internal CSS.

p {

  color: red;

}

This command will make all contents with the opening tags "p" the color red
