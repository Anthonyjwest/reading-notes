# Learning and Understanding Markdown

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) used to add formatting elements to plain text documents! Created by John Gruber in 2004, it is now one of the worlds most popular markup languages. Unlike microsoft office and other WYSIWYG applications, which allow you to click buttons and see changes immediatley. Markdown is different, in that when wanting to make formatting changes to words or phrases, you must use markdown syntax. This syntax is what actually dictates what the words or phrases will look like in your plain text document. 

Now that you understand what markdown is, lets look at why we use it and the benefits it brings!

## Why do we use Markdown? 

To put it breifly, markdown is versatile, flexible, and can be preserved throughout time! Lets look at these key points more closely. 

### Versatile

+ Markdown can be used to create websites, documents, books, notes, presentations, and even email messages
+ Many desktops and web based applications support it

### Flexible

+ Markdown formatted text can be virtually opened in any application
+ Markdown is independent so it can be used on any device with an operating system

### Preservation

+ If the application you used suddenly stops working, the markdown formatted text can be easily read in a text editing appplication

# Applying Markdown Syntax

Lets say you wanted to create a document and at the top of the page you want the header to read "My Life". How would we use syntax to create this? We would simply put "# My Life". That would create the biggest heading we can use! The "#" symbol indicates that the text will be a heading. But lets say you wanted to create the smallest heading underneath saying "Birthplace". Instead of using only one "#", we would use six, to get the smallest heading possible. So it would look like this "###### Birthplace". You may use any number one through six of "#" symbols to vary the size of your headings!

Next lets learn how to bold or italicize text! There are two ways to achieve this, using the * or _ symbols. I would recommend using the * symbol as it doesnt need spaces before and after your text. 

Now lets learn how to create a working link in your project! Lets say you wanted to create a link to a youtube video titled "Tutorial". First we would create the wrapping link text by surrounding it in brackets []. 

+ [Tutorial]

Next we will wrap the actual link address in ().

+ (www.youtubevideofakeurl.com)

Now we would combine the two together to create a working link like so: 

+ [Tutorial](www.youtubevideofakeurl.com)

Lastly lets discuss how to create a bulleted list like seen above. There are three symbols you can use to create a bulleted list; "-", "+", or "*". All you need to do is put one of these symbols before your text to make it into a bulleted list!

+ I
+ made
+ a
+ bullet
+ list
