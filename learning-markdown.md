# Learning and Understanding Markdown

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) used to add formatting elements to plain text documents! Created by John Gruber in 2004, it is now one of the worlds most popular markup languages. Unlike microsoft office and other WYSIWYG applications, which allow you to click buttons and see changes immediatley. Markdown is different, in that when wanting to make formatting changes to words or phrases, you must use markdown syntax. This syntax is what actually dictates what the words or phrases will look like in your plain text document.
